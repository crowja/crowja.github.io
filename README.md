### C scraps

Sometimes it feels like overkill to depend on an external library when all one
needs is a tiny fraction of what it provides. **C scraps** reflects the
minimalist C library philosophy of providing functionality with a minimum of
overhead and comprehensiveness. Basic ideas:

*   Each scrap provides clear, limited functionality.
*   Each is plain old standard C.
*   Drop its .c and .h files into your project and that's it. No formal
    libraries are built.
*   When it makes sense, the scrap is object-oriented and thread-safe. Objects
    are represented by opaque structs.
